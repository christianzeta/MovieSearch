# MovieSearch

This is a simple website i created to learn how to work with HTTPClient in .NET Core. The user can search for movies by title and then get information about it. The API i am using is https://www.omdbapi.com/.
Note that the objective was to interact with the API from ASP.NET Core using razor pages and HttpClient, not to focus on html semantics or other such aspects.

Future updates may focus on html semantics, css animations / responsive design  / and further search abilities.
